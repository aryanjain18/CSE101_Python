    "Write a program that will repeatedly take (for a student) input of this type: course_no, number_of_credits, and grade_received (eg. CSE101 4 A). These inputs are for the courses the student has done in the semester. If no input is given (i.e. just a return), that means no courses are left. From this data, print the transcript for the semester for the student as:\n",

The SGPA is computed as (sum of:  credits*grade/ total_credits).

If input is valid, add to a list of tuples (initially, to check the course name structure just check if it is an alphanumeric string - later write a function to check its valid structure - requires a bit of logic).

If for a student there is EXIT but there is no ENTRY - it means he/she came the day before; similarly if ENTRY but no EXIT, it means that the student will leave next day.

    "Goal is to develop an application for grading in courses at IIIT-Delhi. The application should provide for (i) creating a course for grading with its name, credits, list of assessments with percentage  weight for each (e.g. [(\"quiz\", 5), (\"mid-sem\", 15), …], a grading policy as a list percent for different grades (we will assume that only grades are: A, B, C, D, and F, so this can be [80, 65, 50, 40, 30] (i.e. A above 80, B between 80 and 65, …, F below 30). However, the final cutoff for each grade will be within +/- 2 of the percent specified (i.e. for A it will be between 78 and 82) - it will be the higher of two consecutive marks within this range which have the highest difference. (So, if the marks are 81.9, 81.8, 81.7, 81, 80.9, 80.8…, then the cutoff will be midpoint of 81.7 and 81, which has a largest gap  (ii) adding students' marks for all assessments given in a file - these will be rollno followed by marks for each.  Once marks are given, it should do the grading - apply the policy to determine the grade for each student. \n",

    "Change to:  [80, 65, 50, 40] (i.e. A above 80, B between 80 and 65,..., F below 40)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should then ask the professor what he wants to do: 1. Generate a summary - which should print the course info (name, credits), assessments and their weight, cutoffs for different grades, and grading summary (how many As, how many Bs, etc) 2. Print the grades of all the students in a file as: rollno, total marks, grade (one line for each student). 3. Search for a student record - given the roll no, show marks in different assessments, total marks, and final grade.\n",

    "        Develop this program and use it for grading the \"IP\" course. The assessments and the grading policy is given below (in the main program steps)\n",
