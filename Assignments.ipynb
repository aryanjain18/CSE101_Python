    "Write a program that will repeatedly take (for a student) input of this type: course_no, number_of_credits, and grade_received (eg. CSE101 4 A). These inputs are for the courses the student has done in the semester. If no input is given (i.e. just a return), that means no courses are left. From this data, print the transcript for the semester for the student as:\n",

The SGPA is computed as (sum of:  credits*grade/ total_credits).

If input is valid, add to a list of tuples (initially, to check the course name structure just check if it is an alphanumeric string - later write a function to check its valid structure - requires a bit of logic).
